======

# To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

# Build Tool Instructions
* create a package.json that lists all dependencies and developer dependencies
 * have a start and test npm script
* include an .eslintrc
* include a .gitignore
 * **add the string `db` to a new line in your gitignore file so that you don't include the db directory monogd is storing its files in!**
* include any necessary NPM scripts
  * have a lint script for running eslint
  * have a test script for running mocha
  * have a default script for running the lint and mocha tasks
* a readme with a project description and api docs

# Directions
* Create these directories to organize your code:
 * db - use the command `mongod --dbpath ./db` to start mongod using this directory
 * lib
 * model
 * route
 * test
* Create a HTTP Server using `express`
* Create a **Model** that using `mongoose.Schema` and `mongoose.model`
 * The model can represent what ever data you choose. _e.g. note, blog post, store items_
* use the `body-parser` express middleware to on `POST` and `PUT` routes
<!-- * use the npm `debug` module to log the functions being executed in your app -->
* using the express `Router` create a route for doing **RESTFUL CRUD** operations on your _Model_

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/model-name`
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringified json in the body of a post request to create a resource

### `/api/model-name/:id`
* `GET` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the url endpoint to `req.params` to fetch a model   
* `PUT` request
 * pass data as stringified json in the body of a put request to update a resource
* `DELETE` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the url endpoint to `req.params` to delete a model   

## Tests
* your tests should start your server when they begin and stop your server when they finish
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure your `/api/model-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET` - test 200, response body like `{<data>}` for a request made with a valid id
 * `GET` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found
 * `PUT` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body
 * `PUT` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' for if no `body provided` or `invalid body`
 * `PUT` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found
 * `POST` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' for if no `body provided` or `invalid body`
 * `POST` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body
 * `DELETE` - test 204, with no body, for a request with a valid id
 * `DELETE` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found

## Bonus
* **2pts** a `GET` request to `/api/model-name` should return an array of all stored resources for that model
